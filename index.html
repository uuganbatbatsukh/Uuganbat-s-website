        Previously,  I worked as a Chef at Italian restaurant, Oriental restaurant, English breakfast and Turkish restaurant since I graduated from College. After graduating university in Accounting and Finance which I found the subject is not interesting. However, I looked for a job as account assistant. 
        <br>
        Recently, I'd fallen in mys career trajectory, and due to lack work experience in that industry, I felt like lost hope finding a job i would never enjoy. I trained Judo for years before. But currently, I train thai kickboxing and Brazilian jiu jitsu.
        My favourite is Brazilian jiujitsu and would like to create context regarding Martial arts which can enable potentially earn using expereience and knowledge that I possess.

        I play World of Warcraft and other games on online. Also, I have a great interest in delveloping and creating characters in WOW. Also, I wish to start online business creating web contexts and work for companies that requires websites to run their businesses.
        It is clear evident that  IT sector is expanding and there is huge demand in  tech.  And as i am IT enthuastic and wanted specific technical skills in demand that would land me at job, I started the course with Code Nation to start next job as a junior web developer.

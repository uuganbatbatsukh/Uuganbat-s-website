            <br>
            Building a website without a plan is like constructing a building without blueprints. Planning my website ahead of time would give it  to clear direction  and lay the groundwork for my coming website.

            First, we need analyse of my current  available technologies and softwares to find out if it is outdated,appropriate or needs improvement and think in terms of need is crucial for the successful implmentation of new technologies and softwares. Technologies fail, therefore allways have a back up plans such as hardware, software, cloud storage and others.

            1.7 DESCRIBE LEGAL GUIDELINES AND CONSTRAINTS THAT IMPACT DIGITAL PROJECTS
            <br>
            Europe is now covered by the world's strongest data protection rules. The mutually agreed General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force on May 25, 2018, and was designed to modernise laws that protect the personal information of individuals.
            Before GDPR started to be enforced, the previous data protection rules across Europe were first created during the 1990s and had struggled to keep pace with rapid technological changes. GDPR alters how businesses and public sector organisations can handle the information of their customers. It also boosts the rights of individuals and gives them more control over their information.
            The GDPR is Europe's new framework for data protection laws â€“ it replaces the previous 1995 data protection directive. Previous UK law was based upon this directive.
            As the law was passed there were some controversies. It was amended to protect cybersecurity researchers who work to uncover abuses of personal data, after critics said the law could see their research be criminalised. Politicians also attempted to say there should be a second Leveson inquiry into press standards in the UK but this was dropped at the last minute.
            Individuals, organisations, and companies that are either 'controllers' or 'processors' of personal data will be covered by the GDPR. "If you are currently subject to the DPA, it is likely that you will also be subject to the GDPR," the ICO says on its website.

                <br>
                2.1 THE ONGOING USE OF IT TOOLS AND CHANGE APPROACH AS NEEDED
                <br>

                Generally,  the  ongong use of IT tools are constantly changing while web developers must always be proactive in adapting theses changes , learning new tools  and be willing and eager to accept new challenges. There are many useful tools and resources available out there that can help developers to be more productive and stay informed such Javascript librabries, Dreamweaver, VS Code, Front-end frameworks, PHP, HTML5,  Javascipt, Stackedit,  Slack, Trello and so forth. I completed majority of my project using VS Code and Trello.
                
                <br> 
                2.2 WHETHER THE TOOLS SELECTED WERE APPROPRIATE
                <br>
                Visual Studio Code doesn't require a lot of space to save files and runs fast. It provides many features including IntelliSense that makes coding easier. However, sometimes the settings are confusing and need a time to understand fully. It is worth to mention that the Git integration was very convenient. Also, I found Trello is easy to use and economical . I highly recommend VS Code and Trello as  they are essential  development platforms that every software developers must have.
                
                <br>
                2.3 THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE FINAL PROJECT
                <br>
                Generally, I was very impressed with use of tools to create a website, to the point I've considered creating more websites in future. Because this project is my first ever website, I think it would have been better in terms of quality if I really could stick with it for longer. I've struggled in the beginning of my project but worked almost immediately in VS Code and Trello. I

                2.4 FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO MY PROJECT
                <br>
                I would have need to spend some more time picking out plugins to improve for my workflow and try out different editor such as Sublime and Atom. If I had more times, I would use more customization features such as language tweaks, wrapping, indenting, theming, and more pictures to my website look more outstanding professional in terms of design.
               
                <br>
                2.5 OUTCOMES TO MAKE SURE THEY MATCH REQUIREMENTS AND ARE FIT FOR PURPOSE
                <br>
                I want to become a software developer, so I need to know data access technology well. In order to work effectively with data accessing technogies, I need to learn programming tools and languages. To complete this website project, using Visual Studio Code and Trello matched requirements and were fit for this purpose. VS Code is especially a very complete programming tool, it has its own debugger and and integrated add-ons. It was best choice for the development of my webpages and very useful for me to find my mistakes.
